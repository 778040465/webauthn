Abstract: This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access FIDO 2.0 compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, credentials are stored on a FIDO 2.0 authenticator, and each credential is bound to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user's consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy.

# Use Cases # {#use-cases}

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  <p>This specification defines an API for web pages to access FIDO 2.0 credentials through JavaScript, for the purpose of strongly authenticating a user. FIDO 2.0 credentials are always bound to a single FIDO Relying Party, and the API respects this requirement. Credentials created by a Relying Party can only be accessed by web origins belonging to that Relying Party. Additionally, privacy across Relying Parties must be maintained; scripts must not be able to detect any properties, or even the existence, of credentials belonging to other Relying Parties.</p>

  <p>FIDO 2.0 credentials are located on authenticators, which can use them to perform operations subject to user consent. Broadly, authenticators are of two types:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><dfn>Embedded authenticators</dfn> have their operation managed by the same computing device (e.g., smart phone, tablet, desktop PC) as the user agent is running on. For instance, such an authenticator might consist of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or Secure Element (SE) integrated into the computing device, along with appropriate platform software to mediate access to this device's functionality.</li>
    <li><dfn>External authenticators</dfn> operate autonomously from the device running the user agent, and accessed over a transport such as Universal Serial Bus (USB), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Near Field Communications (NFC).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Note that an external authenticator may itself contain an embedded authenticator. For example, consider a smart phone that contains a FIDO 2.0 credential. The credential may be accessed by a web browser running on the phone itself. In this case the module containing the credential is functioning as an embedded authenticator. However, the credential may also be accessed over BLE by a user agent on a nearby laptop. In this latter case, the phone is functioning as an external authenticator. These modes may even be used in a single end-to-end user scenario. One such scenario is described in the remainder of this section.</p>


## Registration (embedded authenticator mode) ## {#registration-embedded}

    <ul>
      <li>
        On the phone:
        <ul>
          <li>User goes to example.com in the browser, and signs in using whatever method they have been using (possibly a pre-FIDO method such as a password).</li>
          <li>The phone prompts, &quot;Do you want to register this device with example.com?&quot;</li>
          <li>User agrees.</li>
          <li>The phone prompts the user for a previously configured authorization gesture (PIN, biometric, etc.); the user provides this.</li>
          <li>Website shows message, &quot;Registration complete.&quot;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>


## Authentication (external authenticator mode) ## {#authentication-external}

    <ul>
      <li>
        On the laptop:
        <ul>
          <li>User goes to example.com in browser, sees an option &quot;Sign in with your phone.&quot;</li>
          <li>User chooses this option and gets a message from the browser, &quot;Please complete this action on your phone.&quot;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Next, on the phone:
        <ul>
          <li>User sees a discreet prompt or notification, &quot;Sign in to example.com.&quot;</li>
          <li>User selects this prompt / notification.</li>
          <li>User is shown a list of their example.com identities, e.g., &quot;Sign in as Alice / Sign in as Bob.&quot;</li>
          <li>User picks an identity, is prompted for an authorization gesture (PIN, biometric, etc.) and provides this.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Now, on the laptop:
        <ul>
          <li>Web page shows that the selected user is signed in, and navigates to the signed-in page.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>



## Other configurations ## {#other-configurations}

    <p>A variety of additional use cases and configurations are also possible, including (but not limited to):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>User goes to example.com on their laptop, is guided through a flow to create and register a credential on their phone.</li>
      <li>User employs a FIDO 2.0 credential as described above to authorize a single transaction, such as a payment or other financial transaction.</li>
    </ul>


# Conformance # {#conformance}

  <p>This specification defines criteria for a <dfn>conforming user agent</dfn>. A user agent MUST behave as described in this specification in order to be considered conformant. User agents MAY implement algorithms given in this specification in any way desired, so long as the end result is indistinguishable from the result that would be obtained by the specification's algorithms. A conforming FIDO Credential API user agent MUST also be a conforming implementation of the IDL fragments of this specification, as described in the “Web IDL” specification. [[!WebIDL-1]]</p>
  
<!-- begin from signature-format -->
<p> The term <b>Base64url Encoding</b> refers to the base64 encoding using the URL- and filename-safe character set defined in Section 5 of [[RFC4648]], with all trailing '=' characters omitted (as permitted by Section 3.2) and without the inclusion of any line breaks, whitespace, or other additional characters. This is the same encoding as used by JSON Web Signature (JWS) [[RFC7515]].</p>
<!-- end from signature-format -->

# FIDO Authenticator model # {#authenticator-model}
  
  <p>The API defined in this specification implies a specific abstract functional model for a FIDO authenticator. This section describes the FIDO authenticator model. Client platforms may implement and expose this abstract model in any way desired. However, the behavior of the client's FIDO Credential API implementation, when operating on the embedded and external authenticators supported by that platform, MUST be indistinguishable from the behavior specified in the <a href="#api">FIDO Credential API</a> section.</p>
  
  <p>In this abstract model, each FIDO authenticator stores some number of FIDO credentials. Each FIDO credential has an identifier which is unique (or extremely unlikely to be duplicated) among all FIDO credentials. Each credential is also associated with a FIDO Relying Party, whose identity is represented by a Relying Party Identifier (RP ID).</p>
  
  <p>A client must connect to a FIDO authenticator in order to invoke any of the operations of that authenticator. This connection defines an authenticator session. A FIDO authenticator must maintain isolation between sessions. It may do this by only allowing one session to exist at any particular time, or by providing more complicated session management.</p>
  
  <p>The following operations can be invoked by the client in an authenticator session.</p>
  
## The <dfn>authenticatorMakeCredential</dfn> operation ## {#op-make-cred}
    
    <p>This operation must be invoked in an authenticator session which has no other operations in progress. It takes the following input parameters:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The web origin of the script on whose behalf the operation is being initiated, as determined by the user agent and the client.</li>
      <li>The RP ID corresponding to the above web origin, as determined by the user agent and the client.</li>
      <li>All input parameters accepted by the <a><code>makeCredential()</code></a> method, specified below.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When this operation is invoked, the authenticator obtains user consent for creating a new credential. The prompt for obtaining this consent is shown by the authenticator if it has its own output capability, or by the user agent otherwise. Once user consent is obtained, the authenticator generates the appropriate cryptographic keys and creates a new credential. It then associates the credential with the specified RP ID such that it will be able to retrieve the RP ID later, given the credential ID.</p>
    
    <p>On successful completion of this operation, the authenticator returns the type and unique identifier of this new credential to the user agent.</p>

    <p>If the user refuses consent, the authenticator returns an  appropriate error status to the client.</p>

## The <dfn>authenticatorGetAssertion</dfn> operation ## {#op-get-assertion}

    <p>This operation must be invoked in an authenticator session which has no other operations in progress. It takes the following input parameters:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The web origin of the script on whose behalf the operation is being initiated, as determined by the user agent and the client.</li>
      <li>The RP ID corresponding to the above web origin, as determined by the user agent and the client.</li>
      <li>All input parameters accepted by the <a><code>getAssertion()</code></a> method, specified below.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When this method is invoked, the authenticator allows the user to select a credential from among the credentials associated with that Relying Party and matching the specified criteria, then obtains user consent for using that credential. The prompt for obtaining this consent may be shown by the authenticator if it has its own output capability, or by the user agent otherwise. Once a credential is selected and user consent is obtained, the authenticator computes a cryptographic signature using the credential's private key and constructs an assertion as specified in [[#signature-format]]. It then returns this assertion to the user agent.</p>

    <p>If the authenticator cannot find any credential corresponding to the specified Relying Party that matches the specified criteria, it terminates the operation and returns an error.</p>

    <p>If the user refuses consent, the authenticator returns an appropriate error status to the client.</p>

## The <dfn>authenticatorCancel</dfn> operation ## {#op-cancel}
    
    <p>This operation takes no input parameters and returns no result.</p>

    <p>When this operation is invoked by the client in an authenticator session, it has the effect of terminating any <a><code>authenticatorMakeCredential</code></a> or <a><code>authenticatorGetAssertion</code></a> operation currently in progress in that authenticator session. The authenticator stops prompting for, or accepting, any user input related to authorizing the canceled operation. The client ignores any further responses from the authenticator for the canceled operation.</p>
    
    <p>This operation is ignored if it is invoked in an authenticator session which does not have an <a><code>authenticatorMakeCredential</code></a> or <a><code>authenticatorGetAssertion</code></a> operation currently in progress.</p>



# FIDO Credential API # {#api}

  <p>This section normatively specifies the API for creating and using FIDO 2.0 credentials. Support for deleting credentials is deliberately omitted; this is expected to be done through platform-specific user interfaces rather than from a script. The basic idea is that the credentials belong to the user and are managed by the browser and underlying platform. Scripts can (with the user&apos;s consent) request the browser to create a new credential for future use by the script's origin. Scripts can also request the user’s permission to perform authentication operations with an existing credential held by the platform. However, all such operations are mediated by the browser and/or platform on the user&apos;s behalf. At no point does the script get access to the credentials themselves; it only gets information about the credentials in the form of objects.</p>

  <p>User agents SHOULD only expose this API to callers in <dfn>secure contexts</dfn>, as defined in [[powerful-features]].</p>

  <p>In the future, this API may be integrated into a more general Web API framework for credential management, which is being worked on in the W3C. Such integration will, most likely, create intermediate interface and dictionary types, from which the types in this specification will then inherit. However the experience of the FIDO developer and end user will not be substantially changed by this. In the meantime, this specification is maintained in a more minimal form for ease of review.</p>

  <p>The API is defined by the following Web IDL fragment.</p>

## <dfn interface>FIDOCredentials</dfn> Interface ## {#iface-credential}

    <p>This interface consists of the following methods.</p>

### Create a new credential (<dfn method for="FIDOCredentials">makeCredential()</dfn> method) ### {#makeCredential}

      <p>With this method, a script can request the user agent to create a new credential of a given type and persist it to the underlying platform, which may involve data storage managed by the browser or the OS. The user agent will prompt the user to approve this operation. On success, the promise will be resolved with a {{FIDOCredentialInfo}} object describing the newly created credential.</p>

      <p>This method takes the following parameters:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <dfn>accountInformation</dfn> parameter specifies information about the user account for which the credential is being created. This is meant for later use by the authenticator when it needs to prompt the user to select a credential.</li>

        <li>The <dfn>cryptoParameters</dfn> parameter supplies information about the desired properties of the credential to be created. The sequence is ordered from most preferred to least preferred. The platform makes a best effort to create the most preferred credential that it can.</li>

        <li>The <dfn>attestationChallenge</dfn> parameter contains a challenge intended to be used for generating the attestation statement of the newly created credential.</li>

        <li>The optional <dfn>credentialTimeoutSeconds</dfn> parameter specifies a time, in seconds, that the caller is willing to wait for the call to complete. This is treated as a hint, and may be overridden by the platform.</li>

        <li>The optional <dfn>blacklist</dfn> parameter is intended for use by Relying Parties that wish to limit the creation of multiple credentials for the same account on a single authenticator. The platform is requested to return an error if the new credential would be created on an authenticator that also contains one of the credentials enumerated in this parameter.</li>

        <li>The optional <dfn>credentialExtensions</dfn> parameter contains additional parameters requesting additional processing by the client and authenticator. For example, the caller may request that only authenticators with certain capabilities be used to create the credential, or that additional information be returned in the attestation statement. Alternatively, the caller may specify an additional message that they would like the authenticator to display to the user. Extensions are defined in [[#signature-format]].</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When this method is invoked, the user agent MUST execute the following algorithm:<p>

      <ol type="1">


        <li>If <a><code>credentialTimeoutSeconds</code></a> was specified, check if its value lies within a reasonable range as defined by the platform and if not, correct it to the closest value lying within that range. Set <var>adjustedTimeout</var> to this adjusted value. If <a><code>credentialTimeoutSeconds</code></a> was not specified then set <var>adjustedTimeout</var> to a platform-specific default.</li>

        <li>Let <var>promise</var> be a new <a data-lt="Promises">Promise</a>. Return <var>promise</var> and start a timer for <var>adjustedTimeout</var> seconds. Then asynchronously continue executing the following steps.</li>

        <li>Set <var>callerOrigin</var> to the <a><code>origin</code></a> of the caller. Derive the RP ID from <var>callerOrigin</var> by computing the "public suffix + 1" or "PS+1" (which is also referred to as the "Effective Top-Level Domain plus One" or "eTLD+1") part of <var>callerOrigin</var> [[PSL]]. Set <var>rpId</var> to the RP ID.</li>

        <li>Initialize <var>issuedRequests</var> to an empty list.</li>

        <li>
          Process each element of <a><code>cryptoParameters</code></a> using the following steps:

          <ol type="a">

            <li>Let <var>current</var> be the currently selected element of <a><code>cryptoParameters</code></a>.</li>

            <li>If <var>current.type</var> does not contain a {{CredentialType}} supported by this implementation, then stop processing <var>current</var> and move on to the next element in <a><code>cryptoParameters</code></a>.</li>

            <li>Let <var>normalizedAlgorithm</var> be the result of normalizing an algorithm using the procedure defined in [[!WebCryptoAPI]], with <var>alg</var> set to <var>current.algorithm</var> and <var>op</var> set to &quot;generateKey&quot;. If an error occurs during this procedure, then stop processing <var>current</var> and move on to the next element in <a><code>cryptoParameters</code></a>.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>If <a><code>blacklist</code></a> is undefined, set it to the empty list.</li>

        <li>If <a><code>credentialExtensions</code></a> was specified, process any extensions supported by this client platform, to produce the extension data that needs to be sent to the authenticator. Call this data <var>clientExtensions</var>.</li>

        <li>For each embedded or external authenticator currently available on this platform: asynchronously invoke the <a><code>authenticatorMakeCredential</code></a> operation on that authenticator with <var>callerOrigin</var>, <var>rpId</var>, <a><code>accountInformation</code></a>, <var>current.type</var>, <var>normalizedAlgorithm</var>, <a><code>blacklist</code></a>, <a><code>attestationChallenge</code></a> and <var>clientExtensions</var> as parameters. Add a corresponding entry to <var>issuedRequests</var>.</li>

        <li>
          While <var>issuedRequests</var> is not empty, perform the following actions depending upon the <var>adjustedTimeout</var> timer and responses from the authenticators:

          <ol type="a">

            <li>If the <var>adjustedTimeout</var> timer expires, then for each entry in <var>issuedRequests</var> invoke the <a><code>authenticatorCancel</code></a> operation on that authenticator and remove its entry from the list.</li>

            <li>If any authenticator returns a status indicating that the user cancelled the operation, delete that authenticator's entry from <var>issuedRequests</var>. For each remaining entry in <var>issuedRequests</var> invoke the <a><code>authenticatorCancel</code></a> operation on that authenticator and remove its entry from the list.</li>

            <li>If any authenticator returns an error status, delete the corresponding entry from <var>issuedRequests</var>.</li>
            <li>If any authenticator indicates success, create a new {{FIDOCredentialInfo}} object named <var>value</var> and populate its fields with the values returned from the authenticator. Resolve <var>promise</var> with <var>value</var> and terminate this algorithm.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Resolve <var>promise</var> with a <a><code>DOMException</code></a> whose name is "<code>NotFoundError</code>", and terminate this algorithm.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>During the above process, the user agent SHOULD show some UI to the user to guide them in the process of selecting and authorizing an authenticator.</p>




### Use an existing credential (<dfn method for="FIDOCredentials">getAssertion()</dfn> method) ### {#getAssertion}

      <p>This method is used to discover and use an existing FIDO 2.0 credential, with the user's consent. The script optionally specifies some criteria to indicate what credentials are acceptable to it. The user agent and/or platform locates credentials matching the specified criteria, and guides the user to pick one that the script should be allowed to use. The user may choose not to provide a credential even if one is present, for example to maintain privacy.</p>

      <p>This method takes the following parameters:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <dfn>assertionChallenge</dfn> parameter contains a string that the selected authenticator is expected to sign to produce the assertion.</li>

        <li>The optional <dfn>assertionTimeoutSeconds</dfn> parameter specifies a time, in seconds, that the caller is willing to wait for the call to complete. This is treated as a hint, and may be overridden by the platform.</li>

        <li>The optional <dfn>whitelist</dfn> member contains a list of credentials acceptable to the caller, in order of the caller's preference.</li>

        <li>The optional <dfn>assertionExtensions</dfn> parameter contains additional parameters requesting additional processing by the client and authenticator. For example, if transaction confirmation is sought from the user, then the prompt string would be included in an extension. Extensions are defined in a companion specification.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When this method is invoked, the user agent MUST execute the following algorithm:<p>

      <ol type="1">

        <li>If <a><code>assertionTimeoutSeconds</code></a> was specified, check if its value lies within a reasonable range as defined by the platform and if not, correct it to the closest value lying within that range. Set <var>adjustedTimeout</var> to this adjusted value. If <a><code>assertionTimeoutSeconds</code></a> was not specified then set <var>adjustedTimeout</var> to a platform-specific default.</li>

        <li>Let <var>promise</var> be a new <a data-lt="Promises">Promise</a>. Return <var>promise</var> and start a timer for <var>adjustedTimeout</var> seconds. Then asynchronously continue executing the following steps.</li>

        <li>Set <var>callerOrigin</var> to the <a><code>origin</code></a> of the caller. Derive the RP ID from <var>callerOrigin</var> by computing the "public suffix + 1" or "PS+1" (which is also referred to as the "Effective Top-Level Domain plus One" or "eTLD+1") part of <var>callerOrigin</var> [[PSL]]. Set <var>rpId</var> to the RP ID.</li>

        <li>Initialize <var>issuedRequests</var> to an empty list.</li>

        <li>If <a><code>assertionExtensions</code></a> was specified, process any extensions supported by this client platform, to produce the extension data that needs to be sent to the authenticator. Call this data <var>clientExtensions</var>.</li>

        <li>
          For each embedded or external authenticator currently available on this platform, perform the following steps:

          <ol type="a">
            <li>If <a><code>whitelist</code></a> is undefined or empty, let <var>credentialList</var> be a list containing a single wildcard entry.</li> <!-- TBD The wildcard syntax needs to be defined and/or referenced here. -->

            <li>If <a><code>whitelist</code></a> is defined and non-empty, optionally execute a platform-specific procedure to determine which of these credentials can possibly be present on this authenticator. Set <var>credentialList</var> to this filtered list. If <var>credentialList</var> is empty, ignore this authenticator and do not perform any of the following per-authenticator steps.</li>

            <li>Asynchronously invoke the <a><code>authenticatorGetAssertion</code></a> operation on this authenticator with <var>callerOrigin</var>, <var>rpId</var>, <a><code>assertionChallenge</code></a>, <var>credentialList</var>, and <var>clientExtensions</var> as parameters.</li>

            <li>Add an entry to <var>issuedRequests</var>, corresponding to this request.</li>

          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          While <var>issuedRequests</var> is not empty, perform the following actions depending upon the <var>adjustedTimeout</var> timer and responses from the authenticators:

          <ol type="a">

            <li>If the timer for <var>adjustedTimeout</var> expires, then for each entry in <var>issuedRequests</var> invoke the <a><code>authenticatorCancel</code></a> operation on that authenticator and remove its entry from the list.</li>

            <li>If any authenticator returns a status indicating that the user cancelled the operation, delete that authenticator's entry from <var>issuedRequests</var>.

            <li>If any authenticator returns an error status, delete the corresponding entry from <var>issuedRequests</var>.</li>

            <li>If any authenticator returns success, create a new {{FIDOAssertion}} object named <var>value</var> and populate its fields with the values returned from the authenticator. Resolve <var>promise</var> with <code>value</code> and terminate this algorithm.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Resolve <var>promise</var> with a <a><code>DOMException</code></a> whose name is "<code>NotFoundError</code>", and terminate this algorithm.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>During the above process, the user agent SHOULD show some UI to the user to guide them in the process of selecting and authorizing an authenticator with which to complete the operation.</p>


## <dfn interface>FIDOCredentialInfo</dfn> Interface ## {#iface-credentialInfo}

    <div dfn-for="FIDOCredentialInfo">
      <p>This interface represents a newly-created FIDO credential. It contains information about the credential that can be used to locate it later for use, and also contains metadata that can be used by the FIDO Relying Party to assess the strength of the credential during registration.</p>

      <p>The <dfn>credential</dfn> attribute contains a unique identifier for the credential represented by this object.</p>

      <p>The <dfn>algorithm</dfn> attribute contains the cryptographic algorithm associated with the credential, in the format defined in [[!WebCryptoAPI]].</p>

      <p>The <dfn>publicKey</dfn> attribute contains the public key associated with the credential, represented as a JsonWebKey structure as defined in [[!WebCryptoAPI]].</p>

      <p>The <dfn>attestation</dfn> attribute contains a key attestation statement returned by the authenticator. This provides information about the credential and the authenticator it is held in, such as the level of security assurance provided by the authenticator.</p>
    </div>


## User Account Information (dictionary <dfn dictionary>Account</dfn>) ## {#iface-account}

    <div dfn-for="Account">
      <p>This dictionary is used by the caller to specify information about the user account and Relying Party with which a credential is to be associated. It is intended to help the authenticator in providing a friendly credential selection interface for the user.</p>

      <p> The <dfn>rpDisplayName</dfn> member contains the friendly name of the Relying Party, such as "Google", "Microsoft" or "PayPal".</p>

      <p>The <dfn>displayName</dfn> member contains the friendly name associated with the user account by the Relying Party, such as "John P. Smith".</p>

      <p>The <dfn>name</dfn> member contains a detailed name for the account, such as "john.p.smith@example.com".</p>

      <p>The <dfn>id</dfn> member contains an identifier for the account, stored for the use of the Relying Party. This is not meant to be displayed to the user.</p>

      <p>The <dfn>imageUri</dfn> member contains a URI that resolves to the user's account image. This may be a URL that can be used to retrieve the user's current avatar, or a data URI that contains the image data.</p>

    </div>


## Parameters for Credential Generation (dictionary <dfn dictionary>FIDOCredentialParameters</dfn>) ## {#credential-params}

    <div dfn-for="FIDOCredentialParameters">
      <p>This dictionary is used to supply additional parameters when creating a new credential.</p>

      <p>The <dfn>type</dfn> member specifies the type of credential to be created.</p>

      <p>The <dfn>algorithm</dfn> member specifies the cryptographic algorithm with which the newly generated credential will be used.</p> <!-- TBD This should probably say that the type of this field is AlgorithmIdentifier. -->
    </div>


## Supporting Data Structures ## {#supporting-data-structures}
  
    The FIDO credential type uses certain data structures that are specified in supporting specifications. These are as follows.

### Credential Type enumeration (enum <dfn enum>CredentialType</dfn>) ### {#credentialType}

      <div dfn-for="CredentialType">
        <p>This enumeration defines the valid credential types. It is an extension point; values may be added to it in the future, as more credential types are defined. The values of this enumeration are used for versioning the FIDO assertion and attestation statement according to the type of the authenticator.</p>

        <p>Currently one credential type is defined, namely &quot;<dfn>FIDO</dfn>&quot;, the FIDO 2.0 credential type.</p>
      </div>


### Unique Identifier for Credential (interface <dfn interface>Credential</dfn>) ### {#credential-identifier}

      <p>This interface contains the attributes that are returned to the caller when a new credential is created, and can be used later by the caller to select a credential for use.</p>

      <div dfn-for="Credential">
      <p>The <dfn>type</dfn> attribute indicates the specification and version that this credential conforms to.</p> <!-- TBD Why isn't this called "version", since it's a version identifier? -->

        <p>The <dfn>id</dfn> attribute contains an identifier for the credential, chosen by the platform with help from the authenticator. This identifier is used to look up credentials for use, and is therefore expected to be globally unique with high probability across all credentials of the same type. This API does not constrain the format or length of this identifier, except that it must be sufficient for the platform to uniquely select a key. For example, an authenticator without on-board storage may create identifiers that consist of the key material wrapped with a key that is burned into the authenticator.</p>
      </div>


### Cryptographic Algorithm Identifier (type {{AlgorithmIdentifier}}) ### {#alg-identifier}

      <p>A string or dictionary identifying a cryptographic algorithm and optionally a set of parameters for that algorithm. This type is defined in [[!WebCryptoAPI]].</p>


### FIDO Assertion (interface {{FIDOAssertion}}) ### {#iface-assertion}

      <p>FIDO 2.0 credentials produce a cryptographic signature that provides proof of possession of a private key as well as evidence of user consent to a specific transaction. The structure of these signatures is defined in [[#fido-assertion]].</p>


### FIDO Assertion Extensions (dictionary <dfn>FIDOExtensions</dfn>) ### {#iface-assertion-extensions}

      <p>This is a dictionary containing zero or more extensions as defined in [[#extensions]]. An extension is an additional parameter that can be passed to the <a>getAssertion()</a> method and triggers some additional processing by the client platform and/or the authenticator.</p>

      <p>
        If the caller wants to pass extensions to the platform, it SHOULD do so by adding one
        entry per extension to this <code>FIDOExtensions</code> dictionary with 
        the extension identifier as the key, and the extension's value as the value
        (see [[#signature-format]] for details).  
      </p>


### Key Attestation Statement (interface <dfn>AttestationStatement</dfn>) ### {#iface-attestation-statement}

      <p>FIDO 2.0 authenticators also provide some form of key attestation. The basic requirement is that the authenticator can produce, for each credential public key, attestation information that can be verified by a Relying Party. Typically this information contains a signature by an attesting key over the attested public key and a challenge, as well as a certificate or similar information providing provenance information for the attesting key, enabling a trust decision to be made. The structure of these attestation statements is defined in [[!FIDOKeyAttestation]].</p>


<!-- Included from signature-format.html -->

# Signature Format # {#signature-format}
	  

<p>FIDO 2.0 signatures are bound to various contextual data. These data are
observed, and added at different levels of the stack as a signature request
passes from the server to the authenticator. In verifying a signature, the
server checks these bindings against expected values.</p>

<p>The components of a system using FIDO 2.0 can be divided into three layers:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The relying party (RP), which uses the FIDO 2.0 services.
  The relying party may, for
  example, be a web-application running in a browser, or a native application
  that runs directly on the OS platform.</li>
  <li>The client platform, which consists of the user’s OS and device used to
  host the RP’s client-side app. For web-applications, the browser also belongs
  to this layer.</li>
  <li>The authenticator itself, which provides key management and
  cryptographic signatures.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the RP client-side application is a web-application, the interface between 1 and 2
is the <a href="#api">FIDO Credential API</a>, but is platform specific for native applications.
In cases where the authenticator is not tightly integrated with the platform, the interface
between 2 and 3 is a separately-defined protocol.
This specification defines the common signature format
shared by all layers.  This includes how the different contextual bindings are
encoded, signed over, and delivered to the RP.</p>

<p>The goals of this design can be summarized as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scheme for generating signatures should accommodate cases where the
  link between the client platform and authenticator is very limited, in
  bandwidth and/or latency. Examples include Bluetooth Low Energy and Near-Field
  Communication.</li>
  <li>The data processed by the authenticator should be small and easy to
  interpret in low-level code. In particular, authenticators should not have to
  parse high-level encodings such as JSON.</li>
  <li>Both the client platform and the authenticator should have the flexibility
  to add contextual bindings as needed.</li>
  <li>The design aims to reuse as much as possible of existing encoding formats
  in order to aid adoption and implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The contextual bindings are divided in two: Those added by the RP or the
client platform, referred to as <dfn>client data</dfn>; and those added by the
authenticator, referred to as the <dfn>authenticator data</dfn>.  The client
data must be signed over, but an authenticator is otherwise not interested in
its contents. To save bandwidth and processing requirements on the
authenticator, the client platform hashes the client data and sends only
the result to the authenticator. The authenticator signs over the combination
of this hash, and its own authenticator data.</p>

## Client data ## {#sec-client-data}

  <p>The client data represents the contextual bindings of both the RP and the
  client platform.  It is a key-value mapping with string-valued keys. Values may be
  any type that has a valid encoding in JSON.  It MUST contain at least the
  following key-value pairs.</p>
  
  <pre class="idl">
  dictionary ClientData {
	  DOMString       challenge;
	  DOMString       facet;
	  JsonWebKey      tokenBinding;
	  object          extensions; // optional
	  DOMString       hashAlg;
  };
  </pre>
  
  <div dfn-for="ClientData">
  <dl>
    <dt>DOMString <dfn>challenge</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A base64url-encoded challenge provided by the RP.
    </dd>
    <dt>DOMString <dfn>facet</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A string value describing the RP identifier facet.
      When the RP client-side app is a website, this is its fully qualified web origin,
      using the syntax defined by [[RFC6454]]. When the client-side app is a native
      application, this string is a platform specific identifier.
    </dd>
    <dt>JsonWebKey <dfn>tokenBinding</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A JsonWebKey object [[JWK]] describing the public key that this client uses for
      the Token Binding protocol when communicating with the Relying Party.
      This can be omitted if no Token Binding has been negotiated between the
      client and the Relying Party.
    </dd>
    <dt>optional object <dfn>extensions</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      An object with extension-provided authenticator data.
      Signature extensions are detailed in Section <a href="#extensions"></a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>DOMString <dfn>hashAlg</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      The hash algorithm used to compute clientDataHash 
      (see <a href="#authenticator-signature"></a>).  Use "S256" for SHA-256, 
      "S384" for SHA384, "S512" for SHA512, and "SM3" for SM3 
      (see <a href='#iana-considerations'></a>). 
    </dd>
  </dl>
  </div>

  <p>The client data MAY contain additional properties.</p>

  <p>Before making a request to an authenticator, the
  client platform layer SHALL perform the following steps.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>clientDataJSON</var> be the UTF-8 encoded JSON serialization
    [[RFC7159]] of {{ClientData}}.</li>

    <li>Let <var>clientDataHash</var> be the hash (computed using {{hashAlg}}) of 
    <var>clientDataJSON</var>, as an array.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The <var>clientDataHash</var> value is incorporated into a signature
  by a FIDO authenticator (see <a href="#authenticator-signature"></a>).
  It is delivered to integrated authenticators
  in platform specific manners, and to external authenticators as a part of
  a signature request.
  The client platform SHOULD also preserve the exact <code>encodedClientData</code>
  string used to create it, for embedding in a signature object sent back to
  the RP (see <a href="#authenticator-signature"></a>).
  This is necessary since multiple JSON encodings of the same client
  data are possible.</p>
  <p>The hash algorithm {{hashAlg}} used to compute <var>clientDataHash</var> is 
    included in the {{ClientData}} object. This way it is available to the RP and 
    it is also hashed over when computing <var>clientDataHash</var> and hence
    anchored in the signature itself.
  </p>


## Authenticator data ## {#sec-authenticator-data}

  <p>The authenticator data encodes contextual bindings made by the
  authenticator itself. The authenticator data has a compact but extensible
  encoding. This is desired since authenticators can be devices with limited
  capabilities and low power requirements, with much simpler software stacks
  than the client platform components.</p>

  <p>The encoding of authenticator data is a byte array <code>authenticatorData</code>
  of 5 bytes or more, as follows.</p>
  <table style="border-collapse: collapse; border:#eee 1px solid;">
    <tr style="background: #ddd; margin: 5px;">
      <th style="padding: 0 10px">Byte index</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Flags (bit 0 is the least significant bit):
        <ul>
          <li>Bit 0: Test of User Presence (<code>TUP</code>) result.</li>
          <li>Bits 1-6: Reserved for future use (<code>RFU</code>).</li>
          <li>Bit 7: Extension data included (<code>ED</code>). Indicates if the
          authenticator data has extensions.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background: #eaeaea">
      <td>1-4</td>
      <td>Signature counter (<code>signCount</code>), 32-bit unsigned big-endian integer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5-</td>
      <td>Extension-defined authenticator data. This is a CBOR [[RFC7049]] map with extension
      identifiers as keys, and extension authenticator data values as values. See 
      <a href="#extensions"></a> for details.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The <code>TUP</code> flag SHALL be set if and only if the authenticator
  detected a user through an authenticator specific gesture. The <code>RFU</code>
  bits in the flags byte SHALL be set to zero.</p>

  <p>If the authenticator does not include any extension data, it MUST set the
  <code>ED</code> flag in the first byte to zero, and to one if extension data
  is included.</p>

  <p>The figure below shows a visual representation of the
  authenticator data structure.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="img/fido-signature-formats-figure1.svg"/>
    <figcaption><code>authenticatorData</code> layout.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="note">
  The <code>signatureData</code> describes its own length: If the ED flag is not set, it
  is always 5 bytes long. If the ED flag is set, it is 5 bytes plus the CBOR map that follows.
  </p>


## Generating a signature ## {#authenticator-signature}

  <p>A raw cryptographic signature must assert the integrity of both the
  client data and the authenticator data. Thus, an authenticator SHALL
  compute a signature over the concatenation of the <var>authenticatorData</var>
  and the <var>clientDataHash</var>.
  </p>

  <figure id="fig-signature">
    <img src="img/fido-signature-formats-figure2.svg"/>
    <figcaption>Generating a signature on the authenticator.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="note">
    A simple, undelimited concatenation, is safe to use here because the
    <var>authenticatorData</var> describes its own length. The 
    <var>clientDataHash</var> (which potentially has a variable length) 
    is always the last element.
  </p>

  <p>
    The authenticator MUST return both the <var>authenticatorData</var> and
    the raw signature back to the client.
  </p>

## Client encoding of assertions ## {#fido-assertion}

  <p>The client platform uses an authenticator assertion to construct
  the final {{FIDO assertion}} object returned to the RP as follows.</p>

  <pre class="idl">
  interface FIDOAssertion {
	  attribute Credential credential;
	  attribute DOMString  clientData;
	  attribute DOMString  authenticatorData;
	  attribute DOMString  signature;
  };
  </pre>
  
  <div dfn-for="FIDOAssertion">
  <dl>
    <dt>attribute Credential <dfn>credential</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    	An object representing which credential was used to generate an assertion.
    </dd>
    <dt>attribute DOMString <dfn>clientData</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A base64url encoding of <code><dfn>clientDataJSON</dfn></code>.
      (See <a href="#sec-client-data"></a>)
    </dd>
    <dt>attribute DOMString authenticatorData</dt>
    <dd>
      A base64url encoding of <code><dfn>authenticatorData</dfn></code>.
      (See <a href="#sec-authenticator-data"></a>)
    </dd>
    <dt>attribute DOMString <dfn>signature</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A base64url encoding of the raw signature returned from the authenticator.
      (See <a href="#authenticator-signature"></a>)
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>This assertion is delivered to the RP in either a platform specific manner, or
  in the case of web applications, according to the FIDO Web API ([[#api]]).
  It contains all the information that the RP's FIDO server requires to
  reconstruct the signature base string, as well as to decode and validate
  the bindings of both the client- and authenticator data.</p>

# FIDO Extensions # {#extensions}
<p>
  The mechanism for generating FIDO 2.0 credentials, as well as requesting and
  generating FIDO 2.0 assertions, as defined in [[#api]],
  can be extended to suit particular use cases. Each case is
  addressed by defining a <em>registration extension</em> and/or a
  <em>signature extension</em>. Extensions can define additions to the
  following steps and data:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    {{makeCredential()}} request parameters (see [[#api]]) for
    registration extension.
  </li>
  <li>
    {{getAssertion()}} request parameters (see [[#api]]) for
    signature extensions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Client processing, and the {{ClientData}} structure, for
    registration extensions and signature extensions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Authenticator processing, and the <var>authenticatorData</var>
    structure, for signature extensions.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  When requesting an assertion for a FIDO 2.0 credential, an RP can list a set
  of extensions to be used, if they are supported by the client and/or the
  authenticator. It sends the request parameters for each extension in the
  {{getAssertion()}} call (for signature extensions) or
  {{makeCredential()}} call (for registration extensions) to the client
  platform. The client platform performs additional processing for each
  extension that it supports, and augments {{ClientData}} as required
  by the extension. For extensions that the client platform does not support,
  it passes the request parameters on to the authenticator when possible
  (criteria defined below). This allows one to define extensions that affect
  the authenticator only.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, the authenticator performs additional processing for the
  extensions that it supports, and augments <var>authenticatorData</var> as
  specified by the extension.
</p>
<p>
  Extensions that are not supported are ignored.
</p>

## Extension identifiers ## {#extension-id}

  <p>
  Extensions are identified by a string, chosen by the extension author. Extension identifiers
  should aim to be globally unique, e.g., by using reverse domain-name of the defining entity such
  as <code>com.example.fido.myextension</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Extensions that may exist in multiple versions should take care to include a version
  in their identifier. In effect, different versions are thus treated as different extensions.
  </p>

  <p>
  Standard extensions defined by FIDO in this specification use a fixed prefix of <code>fido.</code>
  for the extension identifiers. This prefix should not be used for 3rd party extensions.
  </p>


## Defining extensions ## {#extension-specification}

  <p>
    A definition of an extension must specify, at minimum, an extension
    identifier and an extension client argument sent via the
    {{getAssertion()}} or {{makeCredential()}} call (see below).
    Additionally, extensions may specify additional values in
    {{ClientData}}, <code>authenticatorData</code> (in the case of
    signature extensions), or both.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    An extension that does not define additions to {{ClientData}} nor
    <code>authenticatorData</code> is possible, but should be avoided. In such
    cases, the relying party would have no indication if the extension was
    supported or processed by the client and/or authenticator.
  </p>

  
## Extending request parameters ## {#extension-request-parameters}
  
  <p>
    An extension defines two request arguments. The <dfn>client argument</dfn>
    is passed from the RP to the client in the {{getAssertion()}} or
    {{makeCredential()}} call, while the <dfn>authenticator
    argument</dfn> is passed from the client to the authenticator during the
    processing of these calls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Extension definitions MUST specify the valid values for their client
    argument. Clients are free to ignore extensions with an invalid client
    argument. Specifying an authenticator argument is optional, since some
    extensions may only affect client processing.
  </p>

  <p>
    An RP simultaneously requests the use of an extension and sets its client
    argument by including an entry in the {{credentialExtensions}} 
	or {{assertionExtensions}} dictionary
    parameters to the {{makeCredential()}} or {{getAssertion()}}
    call. The entry key MUST be the extension identifier, and the value
    MUST be the <a>client argument</a>.
  </p>

  <pre class="example highlight">
  var assertionPromise = credentials.getAssertion(..., /* extensions */ {
    "com.example.fido.foobar": 42
  });
  </pre>

  <p>
    Extensions that affect the behavior of the client platform can define their
    argument to be any set of values that can be encoded in JSON. Such an
    extension will in general (but not always) specify additional values to the
    {{ClientData}} structure (see below). It may also specify an
    authenticator argument that platforms implementing the extension are
    expected to send to the authenticator. The authenticator argument should be
    a byte string.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Extensions should aim to define authenticator arguments that are as small
    as possible. Some authenticators communicate over low-bandwidth links such
    as Bluetooth Low-Energy or NFC.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Extensions that do not need to pass any particular argument value, must
    still define a client argument. It is recommended that the argument be
    defined as the constant value <code>true</code> in this case.
  </p>

  <p>
    For extensions that specify additional authenticator processing only, it is
    desirable that the platform need not know the extension. To support this,
    platforms SHOULD pass the client argument of unknown extension as the
    authenticator argument unchanged, under the same extension identifier. The
    authenticator argument should be the CBOR encoding of the client argument,
    as specified in Section 4.2 of [[RFC7049]]. Clients SHOULD silently drop
    unknown extensions whose client argument cannot be encoded as a CBOR
    structure.
  </p>

## Extending client processing ## {#extension-client-processing}

  <p>
    Extensions may define additional processing requirements on the client
    platform during the creation of credentials or the generation of an
    assertion. In order for the RP to verify the processing took place, or if
    the processing has a result value that the RP needs to be aware of, the
    extension should specify a client data value to be included in the
    {{ClientData}} structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The value may be any value that can be encoded as a JSON value. If any
    extension processed by a client defines such a value, the client SHOULD
    include a dictionary in {{ClientData}} with the key
    {{ClientData/extensions}}. For each such extension, the client SHOULD add an
    entry to this dictionary with the extension identifier as the key, and the
    extension's client data value.
  </p>


## Extending authenticator processing with signature extensions ## {#extension-authenticator-processing}

  <p>
    Signature extensions that define additional authenticator processing should
    similarly define an authenticator data value. The value may be any data
    that can be encoded as a CBOR value. An authenticator that processes a
    signature extension that defines such a value must include it in the
    <code>authenticatorData</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As specified in <a href="#sec-authenticator-data"></a>, the authenticator data
    value of each processed extension is included in the extended data part of
    the <code>authenticatorData</code>. This part is a CBOR map, with extension
    identifiers as keys, and the authenticator data value of each extension as
    the value.
  </p>

## Example extension ## {#sample-extensions}

  <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
  <p>
    To illustrate the requirements above, consider a hypothetical extension
    <em>Geo</em>. This extension, if supported, lets both clients and
    authenticators embed their geolocation in signatures.
  </p>

  <p>
    The extension identifier is chosen as <code>com.example.fido.geo</code>.
    The client argument is the constant value <code>true</code>, since the
    extension does not require the RP to pass any particular information to the
    client, other than that it requests the use of the extension. The RP sets
    this value in its request for an assertion:
  </p>
  <pre class="highlight">
  var assertionPromise =
      credentials.getAssertion("SGFuIFNvbG8gc2hvdCBmaXJzdC4",
          {}, /* Empty filter */
          { 'com.example.fido.geo': true });
  </pre>

  <p>
  The extension defines the additional client data to be the client's location, if known,
  as a GeoJSON [[GeoJSON]] point. The client constructs the following client data:
  </p>
  <pre class="highlight">
  {
     ...,
     'extensions': {
         'com.example.fido.geo': {
             'type': 'Point',
             'coordinates': [65.059962, -13.993041]
         }
     }
  }
  </pre>

  <p>
  The extension also requires the client to set the authenticator parameter to the fixed value
  <code>1</code>. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Finally, the extension requires the authenticator to specify its geolocation in the authenticator
  data, if known. The extension e.g. specifies that the location shall be encoded as a two-element
  array of floating point numbers, encoded with CBOR.
  An authenticator does this by including it in the <code>authenticatorData</code>.
  As an example, authenticator data may be as follows (notation taken from [[RFC7049]]):
  </p>

  <pre>
  81 (hex)                      -- Flags, ED and TUP both set.
  20 05 58 1F                   -- Signature counter
  A1                            -- CBOR map of one element
    68                          -- Key 1: CBOR text string of 8 bytes
      66 69 64 6F 2E 67 65 6F   -- "fido.geo" UTF-8 string
    82                          -- Value 1: CBOR array of two elements
      FA 42 82 1E B3            -- Element 1: Latitude as CBOR encoded float
      FA C1 5F E3 7F            -- Element 2: Longitude as CBOR encoded float
  </pre>


# Standard Extensions # {#extension-standard}

  <p>
  This section defines standard extensions defined by the FIDO Alliance.
  </p>

## Transaction authorization ## {#extension-txauth}

  <p>
    This signature extension allows for a simple form of transaction
    authorization. A relying party can specify a prompt string, intended for
    display on a trusted device on the authenticator.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Extension identifier</dt>
    <dd>
      <code>fido.txauth.simple</code> 
    </dd>    
    <dt>Client argument</dt>
    <dd>A single UTF-8 encoded string <em>prompt</em></dd>

    <dt>Client processing</dt>
    <dd>None, except default forwarding of client argument to authenticator argument.</dd>

    <dt>Authenticator argument</dt>
    <dd>The client argument encoded as a CBOR text string (major type 3).</dd>

    <dt>Authenticator processing</dt>
    <dd>The authenticator MUST display the prompt to the user before performing
        the user verification / test of user presence. The authenticator may insert line breaks if needed.</dd>
    
    <dt>Authenticator data</dt>
    <dd>A single UTF-8 string, representing the prompt <em>as displayed</em> (including any
        eventual line breaks).</dd>
  </dl>

  The generic version of this extension allows images to be used as prints as well.  This is allows
  authenticators without a font rendering engine to be used and also supports a richer visual appearance.

    </dd>
    
    <dt>Authenticator data</dt>
    <dd>
      The hash value of the <a>content</a> which was displayed.

## Authenticator Selection Extension ## {#extension-authenticator-selection}

  <p>
    This registration extension allows a Relying Party to guide the selection
    of the authenticator that will be leveraged when creating the credential.
    It is intended primarily for Relying Parties that wish to tightly control
    the experience around credential creation.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Extension identifier</dt>
    <dd>
      <code>fido.authn-sel</code> (only used during {{makeCredential()}})
    </dd>
    <dt>Client argument</dt>
    <dd>
      A sequence of AAGUIDs:
      <pre class="idl highlight">
typedef sequence < AAGUID > AuthenticatorSelectionList;
      </pre>
      Each AAGUID corresponds to an authenticator attestation that is
      acceptable to the RP for this credential creation. The list is ordered by
      decreasing preference.<br>
      
      An AAGUID is defined as a DOMString, and is the globally unique identifier
      of the authenticator attestation being sought.
      <pre class="idl highlight">
typedef DOMString AAGUID;
      </pre>      
    </dd>

    <dt>Client processing</dt>
    <dd>
      If the client supports the Authenticator Selection Extension, it MUST use
      the first available authenticator whose AAGUID is present in the
      {{AuthenticatorSelectionList}}. If none of the available
      authenticators match a provided AAGUID, the client MUST select an
      authenticator from among the available authenticators to generate the
      credential.
    </dd>

    <dt>Authenticator argument</dt>
    <dd>There is no authenticator argument.</dd>

    <dt>Authenticator processing</dt>

# Sample scenarios # {#sample-scenarios}

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  <p>In this section, we walk through some events in the lifecycle of a FIDO 2.0 credential, along with the corresponding sample code for using this API. Note that this is an example flow, and does not limit the scope of how the API can be used.</p>

  <p>As was the case in earlier sections, this flow focuses on a use case involving an external first-factor authenticator with its own display. One example of such an authenticator would be a smart phone. Other authenticator types are also supported by this API, subject to implementation by the platform. For instance, this flow also works without modification for the case of an authenticator that is embedded in the client platform. The flow also works for the case of an external authenticator without its own display (similar to a smart card) subject to specific implementation considerations. Specifically, the client platform needs to display any prompts that would otherwise be shown by the authenticator, and the authenticator needs to allow the client platform to enumerate all the authenticator's credentials so that the client can have information to show appropriate prompts.</p>

## Registration ## {#sample-registration}

    <p>This is the first time flow, when a new credential is created and registered with the server.
    </p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>The user visits example.com, which serves up a script. At this point, the user must already be logged in using a legacy username and password, or additional authenticator, or other means acceptable to the Relying Party.</li>
      <li>The Relying Party script runs the code snippet below.
      <li>The client platform searches for and locates the external authenticator.</li>
      <li>The client platform connects to the external authenticator, performing any pairing actions if necessary.</li>
      <li>The external authenticator shows appropriate UI for the user to select the authenticator on which the new credential will be created, and obtains a biometric or other authorization gesture from the user.</li>
      <li>The external authenticator returns a response to the client platform, which in turn returns a response to the RP script. If the user declined to select an authenticator or provide authorization, an appropriate error is returned.</li>
      <li>If a new credential was created,
      <ol type="a">
        <li>The RP script sends the newly generated public key to the server, along with additional information about public key such as attestation that it is held in trusted hardware.</li>
        <li>The server stores the public key in its database and associates it with the user as well as with the strength of authentication indicated by attestation, also storing a friendly name for later use.</li>
        <li>The script may store data such as the credential ID in local storage, to improve future UX by narrowing the choice of credential for the user.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The sample code for generating and registering a new key follows:</p>


    <pre class="example highlight">
    var fidoAPI = window.fido;

    if (!fidoAPI) { /* Platform not capable. Handle error. */ }

    var userAccountInformation = {
      rpDisplayName: "PayPal",
      displayName: "John P. Smith",
      name: "johnpsmith@gmail.com",
      id: "1098237235409872";
      imageUri: "https://pics.paypal.com/00/p/aBjjjpqPb.png"
    };

    // This RP will accept either an ES256 or RS256 credential, but 
    // prefers an ES256 credential.
    var cryptoParams = [
      { 
        type: "FIDO",
        algorithm: "ES256",
      },
      {
        type: "FIDO",
        algorithm: "RS256",
      }
    ];
    var challenge = "Y2xpbWIgYSBtb3VudGFpbg";
    var timeoutSeconds = 300;  // 5 minutes
    var blacklist = [];  // No blacklist
    var extensions = {"fido.location": true};  // Include location information 
                                               // in attestation


    // Note: The following call will cause the authenticator to display UI.
    fidoAPI.makeCredential(userAccountInformation, cryptoParams, challenge,
                           timeoutSeconds, blacklist, extensions)
      .then(function (newCredentialInfo) {
        // Send new credential info to server for verification and registration.
    }).catch(function (err) {
        // No acceptable authenticator or user refused consent. Handle appropriately.
    });
    </pre>

## Authentication ## {#sample-authentication}

    <p>This is the flow when a user with an already registered credential visits a website and wants to authenticate using the credential.</p>

    <ol type ="1">
      <li>The user visits example.com, which serves up a script.</li>
      <li>The script asks the client platform for a FIDO identity assertion, providing as much information as possible to narrow the choice of acceptable credentials for the user. This may be obtained from the data that was stored locally after registration, or by other means such as prompting the user for a username.</li>
      <li>The Relying Party script runs one of the code snippets below.</li>
      <li>The client platform searches for and locates the external authenticator.</li>
      <li>The client platform connects to the external authenticator, performing any pairing actions if necessary.</li>
      <li>The external authenticator presents the user with a notification that their attention is required. On opening the notification, the user is shown a friendly selection menu of acceptable credentials using the account information provided when creating the credentials, along with some information on the origin that is requesting these keys.</li>
      <li>The authenticator obtains a biometric or other authorization gesture from the user.</li>
      <li>The external authenticator returns a response to the client platform, which in turn returns a response to the RP script. If the user declined to select a credential or provide an authorization, an appropriate error is returned.</li>
      <li>If an assertion was successfully generated and returned,
      <ol type="a">
        <li>The script sends the assertion to the server.</li>
        <li>The server examines the assertion and validates that it was correctly generated. If so, it looks up the identity associated with the associated public key; that identity is now authenticated. If the public key is not recognized by the server (e.g., deregistered by server due to inactivity) then the authentication has failed; each Relying Party will handle this in its own way.</li>
        <li>The server now does whatever it would otherwise do upon successful authentication &mdash; return a success page, set authentication cookies, etc.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>


    <p>If the Relying Party script does not have any hints available (e.g., from locally stored data) to help it narrow the list of credentials, then the sample code for performing such an authentication might look like this:</p>

    <pre class="example highlight">
    var fidoAPI = window.fido;

    if (!fidoAPI) { /* Platform not capable. Handle error. */ }

    var challenge = "Y2xpbWIgYSBtb3VudGFpbg";
    var timeoutSeconds = 300;  // 5 minutes
    var whitelist = [{ type: "FIDO" }];

    fidoAPI.getAssertion(challenge, timeoutSeconds, whitelist)
      .then(function (assertion) {
        // Send assertion to server for verification
    }).catch(function (err) {
        // No acceptable credential or user refused consent. Handle appropriately.
    });
    </pre>

    <p>On the other hand, if the Relying Party script has some hints to help it narrow the list of credentials, then the sample code for performing such an authentication might look like the following. Note that this sample also demonstrates how to use the extension for transaction authorization.</p>

    <pre class="example highlight">
    var fidoAPI = window.fido;

    if (!fidoAPI) { /* Platform not capable. Handle error. */ }

    var challenge = "Y2xpbWIgYSBtb3VudGFpbg";
    var timeoutSeconds = 300;  // 5 minutes
    var acceptableCredential1 = {
      type: "FIDO",
      id: "ISEhISEhIWhpIHRoZXJlISEhISEhIQo=",
    };
    var acceptableCredential2 = {
      type: "FIDO",
      id: "cm9zZXMgYXJlIHJlZCwgdmlvbGV0cyBhcmUgYmx1ZQo=",
    };
    var whitelist = [acceptableCredential1, acceptableCredential2];
    var extensions = { 'fido.txauth.simple': 
                       "Wave your hands in the air like you just don't care" };
            
    fidoAPI.getAssertion(challenge, timeoutSeconds, whitelist, extensions)
      .then(function (assertion) {
        // Send assertion to server for verification
    }).catch(function (err) {
        // No acceptable credential or user refused consent. Handle appropriately.
    });
    </pre>


## Decommissioning ## {#sample-decommissioning}

    <p>The following are possible situations in which decommissioning a credential might be desired. Note that all of these are handled on the server side and do not need support from the API specified here.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Possibility #1 &mdash; user reports the credential as lost.
        <ul>
          <li>User goes to server.example.net, authenticates and follows a link to report a lost/stolen device.</li>
          <li>Server returns a page showing the list of registered credentials with friendly names as configured during registration.</li>
          <li>User selects a credential and the server deletes it from its database.</li>
          <li>In future, Relying Party script does not specify this credential in any list of acceptable credentials, and assertions signed by this credential are rejected.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Possibility #2 &mdash; server deregisters the credential due to inactivity.
        <ul>
          <li>Server deletes credential from its database during maintenance activity.</li>
          <li>In the future, the Relying Party script does not specify this credential in any list of acceptable credentials, and assertions signed by this credential are rejected.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Possibility #3 &mdash; user deletes the credential from the device.
        <ul>
          <li>User employs a device-specific method (e.g., device settings UI) to delete a credential from their device.</li>
          <li>From this point on, this credential will not appear in any selection prompts, and no assertions can be generated with it.</li>
          <li>Sometime later, the server deregisters this credential due to inactivity.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
